UFC Prediction Model
Overview
Welcome to the UFC Prediction Model project! Our goal is to build a robust prediction model for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bouts. By analyzing various fighter attributes such as height, weight, reach, fighting style, and performance records, we aim to predict the outcomes of fair fights between any two active fighters.

Process
1. Data Collection
We'll gather a comprehensive set of data on UFC fighters, including vital statistics (height, weight, reach), fighting style, and historical performance metrics (accuracy, power, etc.). The more data we have, the better our model's predictions will be.

2. Data Cleaning
To ensure accuracy, we'll meticulously clean the collected data. This step is crucial for removing any inconsistencies or outliers that might affect the model's performance.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
With the cleaned data in hand, we'll conduct a deep dive into the world of UFC statistics. Exploratory Data Analysis will help us identify patterns, correlations, and insights that will contribute to the predictive power of our model.

4. Modeling
Using the insights gained from EDA, we'll employ advanced machine learning techniques to develop our UFC prediction model. This model will be capable of forecasting the outcome of a match between any two active fighters, providing fight enthusiasts with an exciting new perspective on potential matchups.

5. Visualization with Tableau
To present our findings in an engaging and accessible way, we'll use Tableau to create visualizations. These visualizations will showcase key trends, fighter profiles, and the overall predictive capabilities of our model.
