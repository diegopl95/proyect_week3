UFC FIGHTERS DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

OVERVIEW

This project aims to leverage data about UFC fighters to explore and eventually attempt to predict the outcome of fights. 

The process involves web scraping fighter data from the UFC Stats website, followed by data cleaning, correlation analysis, and the addition of insightful columns to the dataset. 

The ultimate goal is to enhance the accuracy of a prediction model for the outcome of a fight between two UFC fighters.
